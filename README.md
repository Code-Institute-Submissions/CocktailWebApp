My project is leveraging *free Json API* from [CocktailDB](https://thecocktaildb.com/), Creating a 
front end interface that allow a the website visitor to do the following:
* Browse all the cocktails in the DB, paginated by letter.
* Get a random cocktail.
* Find out all the cocktails feasible with a specific ingredient.
* Suggest to the webmaster any cocktail in particular to include.
 
# UX

This is a website allowing different kind of selection operations over the Cocktail DB, the purpose
of the project is to allow visitors to extract information quickly and in different way.

### The ideal client for this business is:
First and foremost, potential tourists or visitors, for every period of the year. Rome is a good destination regardless
of the season; then the site is targeting in particular:

* People without means of transportation.
* High-Spending segment, because it's located in a central and expensive neighbourhood.
* Returning clients, who wants to keep contact.
* Tourist that would like to enrich their experience with guided tours.

### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* Cocktail recipe for a specific cocktail.
* Random Suggestion to prepare a cocktail.
* Contact the webmaster for suggestions.
* Pictures of the Cocktail.
* Browser all the cocktail.


### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

Barman or Amateur looking for a cocktail need to make an informed decision and they want to explore
all the potential opportunities, not only in visual terms, but also having an ordered list of the 
ingredients. 
The site is presenting them, in a concise and easy-to-use way, everything they need to know.

The goal was to make a strong first impact with the landing page, and therefore move the exploration
and the research on other pages.

* Picture landing page, for a striking Ô¨Årst impression and link to functionalities.
* Catalogue with alphabetic navigation, each letter invoking an *API*.
* A Search by ingredients, page each request calling an *API*.
* A random functionality, calling an *API* and displaying a modal.
* A Modal invoking an *API* callable clicking on a Cocktail card.
* A Contact modal, sending mail to the webmaster.

### Visitor stories

As a visitor of the *Cocktail DB* website I expect the following:

1. To find with ease what I am looking for, I want the layout of the site to make sense so I am not 
confused or frustrated using it. 

1. The information I am presented with to be laid out in a way that is easy for me to digest, so 
that I find my way  through in the quickest possible way.

1. The site to be easily navigable from any device, desktop, tablet or phone. For the content to 
look good and be usable on any of these devices.

1. To learn more about the cocktails I see and their recipe, so that I can prepare them when I want.

1. To find all the cocktails I can with ingredients available.

1. To know how to prepare a cocktail.

 1. [Laptop](wireframes/Wireframe-Laptop.pdf)
 1. [Tablet](wireframes/Wireframe-Tablet.pdf)
 1. [Mobile](wireframes/Wireframe-Mobile.pdf)
 

# Features

All the different part of the project are detailed below.
 
## Existing Features

### Navbar
A responsive navigation bar with link to the landing page on top left. For mobile-sized devices a 
hamburger button on  the top-right expands a menu with links to the different section on the website. 
On larger devices the expanded menu is shown instead. Navigation bar will be static on the top of 
the page, and will have a peach gradient color.
### Landing Page
Landing Page presents a picture of a cocktail, along with a presentation heading, that introduces a 
visitor to the main features of the site: the search and the explore
### Search
A dedicated page for search has been designed, mimic google functionality, with a single search box, 
that gets moved when the search by ingredients is executed. A series of Card appears as a results.
Each of them is clickable and call an *API* which populates a modal with cocktails instruction and 
ingredients. 
### Catalogue
A dedicated section to Browse Catalogue has been designed, with a toolbar for each alphabet letter. 
Clicking on each alphabet letter, the section below gets populated with a series of Card.
Each of them is clickable and call an *API* which populates 
### Random
This functionality is available only by the menu, and a Random cocktail is displayed by a modal, after
an *API* call.
### Contact Form

This page includes a form with 4 required fields:
* Name
* Title
* Email Address
* Message

JS controls have been implemented to avoid leaving the fields empty or to submit invalid mail addresses.
Once the form has been validated, a *mail* will be sent to my personal mail address and the modal 
will be closed. In case of not validated fields, the user will see them with a wrong label displayed.

### Footer

On the very bottom of the page a footer has placed, with a really simple design and warning about
the creater. The footer is moving according to the number of cocktail displayed.


### Colors Palette

![Color Palette](src/images/palette.png)

Shades of Blue and Grey have been used to convey a professional and stable image.

### Fonts

From Google Fonts has been used *Tangerine* font; for the rest of the Headings *Nobile* standard font has been used.

## Features for future releases
- A Section showing favourable user comments.

# Technologies Used

## Libraries

Beside the holy trinity of Web Development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I took advantage of the following technologies:

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to improve Scroll Up between Section and to show a *Modal* after submitting Contact 
    Form.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project relies heavily on **Bootstrap** component and predefined styles.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - **FontAwesome** is the source of the icons.
- [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)
    - **Popper** is used for the scrolling between different sections.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 
    - to style the website fonts
    
## Tools

In terms of Tools I used the following tools, to develop and design:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    -  My favourite IDE, used to generate a local website and edit each file.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - WireFrame Designer, used with CodeInstitute license, definitively to best resource to wireframe.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
    - Site has been tested on both popular Browser for several distinct dimensions.
    

# Testing

I used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
to check the validity of the website code.

The work has been reviewed by a number of relatives and friend, mostly on the mobile, each of them giving suggestions.

The website has been test with multiple resizing to test the its responsiveness.
via the *inspect* chrome functionality it has been examined for the most popular mobile devices such as 
* iPhone 6/7/8
* iPad
* Galaxy S5

also following section has been tested:

1. Iframe Map: zooming in and out of the map.

1. Carousel: sliding through the rooms' pictures composing the carousel, testing indicators at the bottom
of the slides.

1. Contact form via the following routine:
    1. Going to the "Contact" Section
    2. Trying to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Trying to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Trying to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that the modal will appear.

1. Gallery to showcase the closest point of interest.

Bugs: most relevant bugs to tackle involved *bootstrap4 carousel* which arrows indicators
pushed navigation to the top of the section, but changing the `data-target` field solved it.
Other issues involved the JavaScript-powered scrolling which at some point was not adapting 
to new component added, and this meant refactoring from the original version.

Navigation with key was not enabled by default on galley modals, so I had to write a jQuery function 
on my own.

A Bug I wasn't able to reproduce was the scrollbar at the bottom that was appearing on the laptop of my mentor; despite 
my effort it never showed up during my testing to me or to other testers.

# Deployment

Site has been developed on PyCharm and pushed to GitHub via terminal commands.
code can be fetched locally with following command
```shell
git clone https://github.com/severian5it/Milestone1.git
```
## how to run this project locally
is possible to run it locally running a python server on the same location on index.html and then visiting 
*localhost:8000*
```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
## heroku deployment
Code was deployed to heroku which features a full integration with git with the following instructions.
First use heroku create CLI command, which  instantiates a new empty application on Heroku, 
along with an associated empty Git repository.
```shell
heroku apps:create milestone1-pierluca
```
then, every time the local development was satisfying, the local branch can be pushed in production
with following instruction:
```shell
git push heroku master
```
no variable must be set, all the dependency are managed by the file `index.php`, which presence is mandatory
, and must contains at least the entry point for the application, as below:
```php
<?php header( 'Location: /index.html' ) ;  ?>
```
